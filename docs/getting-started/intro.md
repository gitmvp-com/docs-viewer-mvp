# Getting Started

Welcome to the Documentation Viewer MVP! This is a simplified version of a documentation system.

## What is this?

This MVP demonstrates how to build a documentation site with:

* **Markdown files** for content
* **YAML configuration** for table of contents
* **Next.js** for the web framework
* **Clean navigation** for browsing docs

## Key Features

### 1. Markdown Support

All documentation is written in Markdown format, making it easy to write and maintain.

### 2. YAML Table of Contents

The structure is defined in `toc.yml`, allowing for easy organization.

### 3. Simple Navigation

Browse through topics using the sidebar navigation.
